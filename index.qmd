ML Scientist living in Taipei. 

Previously, PhD student in the Department of Genetics at the University of Cambridge. Thinking about how to think about how cells think.

I spent the [summer of 2022](/posts/gsoc) working as part of the Google Summer of Code program on [dynamax](https://github.com/probml/dynamax) a library for state-space models in JAX.
